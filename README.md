3. Leave "Initialize this repository with a README" unchecked (we already have everything).
4. Run the following commands in your project terminal:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/aura-notes-pwa.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 2: Automated Deployment on Cloudflare Pages

You can choose either of two simple methods:
